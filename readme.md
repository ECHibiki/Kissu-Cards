## About
This library was created for friends and associates to celebrate 2021's end of year holidays.

## Codepen Examples
These were created to learn mroe about WebGL and Javascript's Canvas features.<br/>
Examples are made to work on FireFox browsers. Chrome based ones have an annoying feature to do with autoplay that prevents canvas handlers from attaching on window load.<br/>
